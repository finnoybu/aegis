# AEGIS DECISION LOG

## 2026-01-26
- Project initiated under the name "Aegis"
- Defined as an OS-native Intent Engine, not a chatbot or agent
- Adopted First Law: consequences before action
- Chose illumination over automation as core philosophy
- Established Intent Card as the primary interface primitive
- Explicitly rejected silent autonomy in v1

## 2026-02-03
Decision: Formalize Aegis as a public, version-controlled repository.
Rationale: Canonical governance, architecture, and security documents reached sufficient maturity
to require durable versioning, external review, and change tracking.
Impact: All future changes are governed by AEGIS_META_INDEX.md and logged explicitly.
