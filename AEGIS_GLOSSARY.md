# AEGIS GLOSSARY

## Intent
A human-expressed goal, not an instruction.
Example: “Make this ready for the website.”

## Plan
A structured, stepwise proposal of actions Aegis intends to take
to fulfill an intent.

## Action
A single executable operation with a defined capability and scope.

## Capability
A permissioned class of action (e.g., fs.read, net.fetch).

## Scope
The boundary within which a capability is allowed to operate.

## Intent Card
The human-facing representation of an intent, its plan, risks,
impacts, energy cost, and reversibility.

## Illumination
The act of making consequences and tradeoffs explicit before execution.

## Reversibility
The ability to undo or recover from an action, preferably automatically.

## Refusal
A deliberate, explainable decision by Aegis not to act.
Refusal is a feature, not a failure.

## Autonomy
The degree to which Aegis can act without immediate human approval.
In v1, autonomy is always bounded.
